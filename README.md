# EXPERIMENT 4: C++ Bitwise Operators

## Aim
- To study and implement bitwise operators in C++.
- To understand how bit-level operations can be used in programming.

## Apparatus
- Programiz Online Compiler or Visual Studio (VS)

## Theory

### Bitwise Operators in C++
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers. These operators are useful in systems programming, embedded development, and performance-critical applications where direct bit manipulation is required.

C++ provides the following bitwise operators:
- `&` (AND)
- `|` (OR)
- `^` (XOR)
- `~` (NOT)
- `<<` (Left Shift)
- `>>` (Right Shift)

Each operator manipulates individual bits of integer values to produce a new result based on logical rules.

## Functions

- Apply bitwise operators on integer values.
- Understand how each operator affects the binary representation of numbers.
- Perform tasks like masking, setting, toggling, or clearing bits.
- Observe the effect of left and right shifts on binary values.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how to use bitwise operators in C++ and how they manipulate the binary representation of integers. I practiced applying AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift left, and shift right operations. This experiment gave me insight into low-level data manipulation and how bitwise logic is useful in real-world programming scenarios.
